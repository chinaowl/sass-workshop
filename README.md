# Sass Workshop

## Setup

If you haven't already, [install Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install):

`gem install sass`

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for changes, run:

`sass --watch sass:css`

## To do

Currently, `sass/main.scss` contains pure CSS. Your goal is to refactor the CSS using Sass features.
